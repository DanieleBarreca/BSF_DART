For a quick test drive of DART you can access a demo account with limited features on our public instance (in case you get logged out the username/password is demo ). You can try out the following: Run a query in real-time using a predefined panel/query on the samples of our demo dataset published on zenodo Explore the variants resulting from the query Look at a sample report and download it in csv and json format Load a report JSON in the viewer (available also without login) Install and use a local stand-alone instance Requirements and pre-requisites This workflow was tried on MacOS Mojave and on a Linux Debian distribution. You must have DOCKER installed and running on your machine: for LINUX please be sure that both the docker and docker-compose packages are installed. We suggest to dedicate at least 2 CPUs and 4GB of RAM to the Docker daemon. The complete installation files, data input files and database files need around 30GB of space on disk. Installation Download and extract the lastet release binary DART-server-1.0.0-install.tar.gz : wget --no-http-keep-alive https://github.com/DanieleBarreca/BSF_DART/releases/download/1.0.0/DART-server-1.0.0-install.tar.gz tar -xzvf DART-server-1.0.0-install.tar.gz Start the application server To start the application server you can use the start script: bash DART-server-1.0.0/start.sh Please note that the server log is under DATA/log/server.log. The server can take some time before being up and running. DO NOT remove the installation folder DART-server-1.0.0 since all the data resides here! In the DATA folder of the installation folder you will find: A log folder where the application server logs are written A mongo folder where the mongodb files are written A mysql folder where the mysql files are written A projects folder where your project data reside Download and load the demo data To load data on your local installation of DART you should create a project in your installation folder under DATA/projects and then run the loader (make sure the application server is up and running). To download and extract our demo trio project (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4314874), you can use the following: cd DART-server-1.0.0 wget --no-http-keep-alive https://zenodo.org/record/4320863/files/DART_Demo_Trio.tar.gz tar -xzf DART_Demo_Trio.tar.gz Once the project is extracted in the DATA/projects folder you can load it in DART using the command from terminal docker exec -it dart-server './bin/dart_loader/loader.sh' 'DART_Demo_Trio' Access the tool Open your browser (tested with Google Chrome and Firefox) on localhost:8080 and login using the credentials: User: DART_user Password: changeme You can refer to the guides in this documentation for usage details.

Sample selection A sample identifier is searched and selected across all accessible VCF files. The list can be filtered by the sample and file name. To select a sample, double-click on its name. Virtual Gene Panel Disease specific panels can be pre-defined in DART to simplify analyses of known phenotypes. Panels can be defined as HGNC gene names or as genomic relevant regions in BED file format. The use of panels can be enforced to prevent secondary findings. Filtering The query system allows to create rules (filtering conditions) on each of the VCF fields. The rules can be logically group together. Disease specific filtering strategies can be prepared to allow for different modes of inheritance (e.g. dominant, recessive) and expected frequency in the population. Query status Once the query is submitted its status is visualized. For each filtering strategy there are three queries running: count: the query counts of all variants meeting the criteria variants: the query returns the first 2000 variants meeting the criteria coverage: the query returns all the problematic regions within the selected virtual panel Query result By clicking on the banner close to the variants or coverage query statuses, the results can be explored. Variant details By double clicking on a variant relevant information is visualised in a summary panel Sequencing reads visualization By clicking on the Reads panel a genome browser is shown in order to investigate sequencing and alignment quality Disease focus Disease context specific analysis of a patient enables the clinical assessment of variants for the selected disease(s). Previous variant annotations are displayed and highlighted depending on the disease focus. For a given patient it is possible to specify a phenotype by clicking on the clincal curation icon Variant curation DART supports the ACMG-AMP annotation of variants in the disease context. Variant annotations are stored in DART as a knowledge base and provided as guidance across samples and diseases. The variants can be both annotated for quality by clicking on the VALIDATION column, in which case the annotation is specific for the variant, the sample and the vcf file or by clincal significance by clicking on the ANNOTATIONS column, in which case the annotation is specific for the variant and the selected phenotype. Validation curation Pathogenicity curation Visualization of annotated variants Report generation Once the curation activity is complete, a report can be generated by clicking on the disk icon. Please, note that both the panel preset (even if empty) and the query preset must be saved and given a name by clicking on the respective \"hearth\" icon: Saving a report can take some time since all the variants and coverage results are saved permantently in the SQL database.
