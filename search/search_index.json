Rapid identification of the causal mutation(s) provides a molecular diagnosis that can inform potentially invasive treatment decisions and reduces the need for lengthy (and often costly) testing. Genetic diagnoses are currently hampered by the large number of potential disease genes, by the high number of variants identified and by the complexity of variant annotation, which can lead to major delays in reaching a confident genetic diagnosis. Reporting variants DART is a user-friendly, non-commercial software tool that assists researchers and clinicians with the filtering and interpretation of genetic variants obtained by next generation sequencing (e.g. diagnostic panels, exome sequencing, or whole genome sequencing. DART facilitates confident genetic diagnoses in compliance with emerging community standards. Starting with an annotated VCF file, DART supports interactive filtering, implements ACMG- AMP classification, provides full audit history, and helps generate custom patient reports. Going the extra mile Starting with an annotated VCF file, DART supports the user by providing Sample focused analysis Virtual gene panels Standardized filtering Interactive exploration and visualization of variants Disease focused variant analysis Trio / relatedness variant representation Support ACMG-AMP variant curation Full control DART rivals commercial variant annotation software in terms of features and user-friendliness, and \u2013 as an open source software with no strings attached \u2013 it puts the full control over genetic data back in the hands of the clinical laboratories that analyse the data.

Sample selection A sample identifier is searched and selected across all accessible VCF files. The list can be filtered by the sample and file name. To select a sample, double-click on its name. Virtual Gene Panel Disease specific panels can be pre-defined in DART to simplify analyses of known phenotypes. Panels can be defined as HGNC gene names or as genomic relevant regions in BED file format. The use of panels can be enforced to prevent secondary findings. Filtering The query system allows to create rules (filtering conditions) on each of the VCF fields. The rules can be logically group together. Disease specific filtering strategies can be prepared to allow for different modes of inheritance (e.g. dominant, recessive) and expected frequency in the population. Query status Once the query is submitted its status is visualized. For each filtering strategy there are three queries running: count: the query counts of all variants meeting the criteria variants: the query returns the first 2000 variants meeting the criteria coverage: the query returns all the problematic regions within the selected virtual panel Query result By clicking on the banner close to the variants or coverage query statuses, the results can be explored. Variant details By double clicking on a variant relevant information is visualised in a summary panel Sequencing reads visualization By clicking on the Reads panel a genome browser is shown in order to investigate sequencing and alignment quality Disease focus Disease context specific analysis of a patient enables the clinical assessment of variants for the selected disease(s). Previous variant annotations are displayed and highlighted depending on the disease focus. For a given patient it is possible to specify a phenotype by clicking on the clincal curation icon Variant curation DART supports the ACMG-AMP annotation of variants in the disease context. Variant annotations are stored in DART as a knowledge base and provided as guidance across samples and diseases. The variants can be both annotated for quality by clicking on the VALIDATION column, in which case the annotation is specific for the variant, the sample and the vcf file or by clincal significance by clicking on the ANNOTATIONS column, in which case the annotation is specific for the variant and the selected phenotype. Validation curation Pathogenicity curation Visualization of annotated variants Report generation Once the curation activity is complete, a report can be generated by clicking on the disk icon. Please, note that both the panel preset (even if empty) and the query preset must be saved and given a name by clicking on the respective \"hearth\" icon: Saving a report can take some time since all the variants and coverage results are saved permantently in the SQL database. It is highly recommended to narrow the filtering to a specific gene panel to save storage and time.","title":"Query"},{"location":"guide-queries/#query-samples","text":"Queries allow the filtering of sample variants , to investigate relations to other samples, to load virtual gene panels (gene names or genomic relevant regions) and predefined standardised filters .","title":"Query Samples"},{"location":"guide-queries/#sample-selection","text":"A sample identifier is searched and selected across all accessible VCF files.
